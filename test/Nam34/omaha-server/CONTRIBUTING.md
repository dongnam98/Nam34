#Contributing to Omaha-server

Omaha-server is an open source project and Crystalnix as the owner welcomes everyone who would like to help us by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

In general, we stick to [Contributing to Open Source on GitHub](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/) with one modification which is important for us:

* **Pull requests.** Please, post your pull requests to the “dev” branch instead of “master”. We’re using the “master” branch only for stable changes.

Please, don’t forget about [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) (Style Guide for Python Code) and unit-tests, it’ll increase the chance that your pull request will be accepted.
